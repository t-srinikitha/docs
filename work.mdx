People often ask why do you have short stints in your work history. I say, it just happened that way. I did not have an intent to leave it. But, I have been making a difference and creating a lasting impact in every place I have been.

## Senior Executive at NRB Bearings
I started my career at NRB Bearings where I was working as a Senior Executive for their Center for Process Innovation and Sustainable Development(CPISD). I was working on innovating process and ensuring the sustainability along with ensuring the quality. 

I think I was able to make a difference because even today after 7 years of leaving the company, I am still being called by my colleagues. But sadly, I faced sexual harassment(an old man showed me a video and said "Figure accha hai na?" and being chased by shopfloor workers outside work a couple of times, many times I had to hear comments on my hair, my figure, my weight etc.) And, the worst part, I did not complain.


Then, I applied to Shell, Reliance etc for working on their sustainability projects. I could not get a similar job.

## Innovation Fellow at Government of Telangana

I was one of the 6 fellows(out of 1000+ applicants) selected for the Innovation Fellowship program by the Government of Telangana. We were given 6-7 mandates to choose - school innovation, investor ecosystem, hyderabad startup ecosystem, grassroots innovation, etc. I chose grassroots innovation and worked with Palle Srujana and many other organizations to promote innovation in tier 2/3 cities of Telangana. I would say this was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. I got to create impact in the lives of many people. That's the power of the government - if you have will and support, you can do so much.

One day I was waiting for a friend in IIIT Hyderabad, and some stranger approached me asking if I was Sri Nikitha and I said yes. He said that I did an entrepreneurship drive in their city and he was selected for the CIE incubator program. Now, he is building his startup and I changed his life. He saluted me and left. I got tears in my eyes. 

All the while when I was applying for Masters and jobs after the fellowship, I had self doubt and imposter syndrome. I thought I did nothing in my life. This small gesture of a stranger helped me realise that I did something great.
During the fellowship, I collaborated with the Invest India,Office of Scientific Advisor, Ministry of External Affairs, NGOs, startups, founders, investors, etc. to design programs, implement them in 31+ districts, 30+ colleges and impacted 10000+ aspiring entrepreneurs by creating a network of mentors, incubators and system to support them. 

Infact, today, the programs and campaigns I have designed are still being implemented. And, it's the only state with Grassroots Innovation Policy and movies made on two innovators - Mallesham and Shanmukha. I wanted to make innovation - a household word and I want being called an Innovator should be something of pride. I think my mission is being pursued and fulfilled to some extent.

## Incoming student at MS in Sustainable Systems, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

Covid hit and many scholarships discontinued for that year. The job roles of people after the course did not excite me. 

And, during this time, I was working on building something like Rangde or Kickstart for frugal innovation. I couldn't find any viable solution there.

## Senior Consultant at Five Elements SDG

I used to coldcall hundreds of manufacturers through IndiaMart for giving an order to manufacture Dies to make fiberglass composite material structures for sustainable housing for French company.

It was crazy experience and now I know who are the manufacturers and main players in the fiberglass and composite markets.

## Product Growth, Mason 

Somehow, this team has helped me to get confident in my own skin. I worked on marketing, community and random startup things with stellar team. Infact, our team launched two products on Product Hunt and we have been awarded Product of the Year -eCommerce category.

## Product Manager, Facets.cloud

I believe in chances and I was given such a chances at Facets. Facets is an Internal Developer Platform for automating devops workflows. On my first day I asked what is cloud infrastructure and to that extent I was clueless about the field. And, I was the founding product manager. 

My style of working - learn and be inquisitive. I did some courses, talked to the engineers in the team and talked to our customers to learn about Devops from practitioners pov.

I realised that my strength is that I can thrive in any field given that I'm put to solve problems.

## Product Consultant, Mantis

Learning AI and building AI workflows to build website, products, marketing collaterals and what not.
