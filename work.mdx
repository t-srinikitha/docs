I've always been driven by two things: solving meaningful problems and creating lasting impact. My path has taken me from manufacturing floors to government innovation programs, and finally to the heart of developer tooling and AI products. Each role has added a unique perspective to how I approach product challenges.
## Current Adventures in Tech

### Building Developer Tools at Facets.cloud
The best stories often start with a moment of complete honesty. On my first day as the founding Product Manager at Facets.cloud, I asked "What exactly is cloud infrastructure?" Yes, really! But that's exactly what makes this journey special.
I dove headfirst into the world of DevOps and cloud infrastructure. Through countless conversations with engineers, intensive learning sessions, and direct customer interactions, I transformed from someone who didn't know Kubernetes from containers to a PM leading the vision for an Internal Developer Platform.
What made this possible? An insatiable curiosity and a methodology I've refined over years: learn deeply, question constantly, and always start with the user's pain points. Working alongside brilliant engineers, we've built solutions that are fundamentally changing how development teams work with their infrastructure.

### Crafting Product Experiences at Mason
At Mason, I found my groove in a team that helped me become more confident and experimental. We didn't just build products - we crafted experiences that resonated with our community. Our team's dedication led to two successful Product Hunt launches, culminating in winning Product of the Year in the eCommerce category.

### The Government Innovation Chapter
My time as an Innovation Fellow with the Government of Telangana stands as a testament to what's possible when vision meets scale. Selected as one of 6 fellows from over 1000 applicants, I chose to focus on grassroots innovation - a decision that would lead to some of my most fulfilling work.
We didn't just run programs; we transformed how innovation was perceived in tier 2/3 cities. Working across 31+ districts and 30+ colleges, we built a network that supported over 10,000 aspiring entrepreneurs. The impact? Today, Telangana stands as the only state with a dedicated Grassroots Innovation Policy, and our programs continue to nurture new innovators. The impact of our work reached far beyond state borders - Netflix commissioned a movie based on one of our innovators' stories, bringing grassroots innovation to a global audience. Another innovator's work caught international attention, leading to the Ministry of External Affairs commissioning them to gift their innovation to the Government of Kenya, showcasing India's grassroots innovation on the global stage.
One of my proudest achievements was seeing innovation become a household word in these communities. When an entrepreneur from a small city told me years later that our program had changed his life and led to his startup being incubated at CIE, I knew we had created something truly meaningful.

## Early Career Foundations

### Manufacturing Innovation at NRB Bearings
At NRB Bearings' Center for Process Innovation and Sustainable Development, I learned the fundamentals of process improvement and sustainable development. Working on the manufacturing floor taught me valuable lessons about quality, efficiency, and the importance of user-centered design - principles that still influence my product decisions today.

### Sustainable Development at Five Elements SDG
My role at Five Elements SDG exposed me to the challenges of sustainable housing and manufacturing. Through extensive market research and vendor partnerships for fiberglass composite materials, I gained insights into how products come to life from concept to manufacturing - knowledge that proves invaluable in my product management journey.

## The AI Frontier
Currently, as a Product Consultant at Mantis, I'm exploring the fascinating world of AI workflows. We're building systems that automate website development, product creation, and marketing collateral generation - pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI integration.

## What I've Learned
Through this journey, I've discovered that my superpower is the ability to thrive in any domain by:
- Approaching each challenge with genuine curiosity and a structured learning mindset
- Building bridges between technical complexity and user needs
- Creating systems and processes that outlast my involvement
- Turning vision into reality through careful program design and execution

Every role has reinforced my belief that the best products come from a deep understanding of user problems, combined with the technical knowledge to solve them effectively. Whether it's developer tools, government programs, or AI solutions, the fundamental principle remains: create lasting impact by solving real problems for real people.
