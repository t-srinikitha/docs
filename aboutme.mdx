I'm a full-time problem solver and a part-time product manager, working across B2B dev tools, industrial waste management, and grassroots innovation for the last 7\+ years.

Lately, I've been fascinated with how the AI can affect DevOps workflows and work as a PM \+ GTM consultant with [Mantis AI](https://getmantis.ai/). Currently, I'm consulting for **DrDroid**, an AI SRE agent for automatic debugging and resolution of issues.
